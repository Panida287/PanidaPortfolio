    "description": "<p>This was my first design assignment which I used throughout my HTML, CSS, and Javascript assignments with a little bit of adjustments due to the limitation of my skill at the time. But I want to keep improving it.</p><p>SquareEyes is a video streaming website that I chose out of 3 choices, which were:</p><ul><li>- SquareEyes - Video Streaming service</li><li>- GameHub - Online Game store</li><li>- RainyDay - Clothing store</li></ul><br><p>I chose SquareEyes because I feel like it is the service I use the most and it is the most challenging to design in my opinion. This project includes <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and working with <strong>API</strong> with <strong>JavaScript</strong> as well as basic <strong>JavaScript</strong> functions.</p>",
